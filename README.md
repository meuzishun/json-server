# Mock Server with JSON Server

This project is a simple and reusable mock API powered by [`json-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server). It's designed to quickly spin up a RESTful API for frontend development, testing, or prototyping.

## üöÄ Features

- Zero-setup mock API
- Supports GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
- Reusable for any project

## üì¶ Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

2. **Start the mock server**:

```bash
npm run server
```

By default, the server runs at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Create Your Own `db.json`

Create a `db.json` file at the root of the project:

```json

      "name": "Alice Johnson",
